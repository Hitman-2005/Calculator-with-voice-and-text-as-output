# Calculator-with-voice-and-text-as-output
# This program will only work for Windows user only.

This project is made by Hitman-2005 for fun.
The program will do a mathematical calculation such addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
The main part for this program is not only the text output calculation result but as well as voice calculation result in a .mp3 file which will be created automatically when the 1st, 2nd numbers and operator are input and the .mp3 file will also be save in the same python file directory and will also the run .mp3 file after it is save automatically.

So, only the work we need to do is simply just input the 1st, 2nd numbers and operator only.

Have a nice day/good night.:üíï‚ù§Ô∏è
